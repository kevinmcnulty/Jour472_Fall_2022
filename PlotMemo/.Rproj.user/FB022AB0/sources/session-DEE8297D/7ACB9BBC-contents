## Load libraries and establish settings
```{r}
# Turn off scientific notation
options(scipen=999)

# Load the tidyverse,rvest,janitor
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

## Load data
```{r}
med_income <- read_csv("Median_Household_Income.csv")

crime <- read_csv("Crime_Rate.csv")

```

##Which neighborhoods have the lowest income? Which neighborhoods have the highest crime?

I made these tables to get an idea of the neighborhoods with the lowest income and neighborhoods with the highest crime to see if there was a clear overlap. About half of the 15 neighborhoods with the lowest income were also in the top 15 with the highest crime.

```{r}
med_income_2020 <- med_income %>% 
  select(CSA2020, mhhi20) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mhhi20)) %>% 
  slice_min(mhhi20, n=15)

crime_2020 <- crime %>% 
  select(CSA2020, crime20) %>% 
  arrange(desc(crime20)) %>% 
  slice_max(crime20, n=15)

low_income15_high_crime15 <- cbind.data.frame(med_income_2020, crime_2020)
low_income15_high_crime15 <- janitor::clean_names(low_income15_high_crime15)

```

##Do neighborhoods with less than national average median household incomes ($67,521 in 2020) have more, less or equal crime (47.7 national crime rate) to neighborhoods with more than national average median household incomes in 2020?

High income neighborhoods tend to have low crime. Only two high income neighborhoods have high crime, while 11 high income neighborhoods have low crime. Low income neighborhoods are more evenly split. There are 23 low income neighborhoods with high crime and 19 low income neighborhoods with low crime. I would say this shows that high income neighborhoods are more likely to have low crime and low income neighborhoods are just slightly more likely to have high crime.

```{r}
test <- cbind.data.frame(med_income, crime)
test <- janitor::clean_names(test)
  
test2 <- test %>% 
  select(csa2020, mhhi20, crime20)

main <- test2 %>%
  mutate(
    income_level = case_when(
        mhhi20 < 67521 ~ "low_income",
        mhhi20 >= 67521 ~ "high_income"
      )
  ) %>% 
    mutate(
    crime_level = case_when(
        crime20 <= 47.7 ~ "low_crime",
        crime20 > 47.7 ~ "high_crime"
      )
  ) 

low_income_high_crime <- main %>% 
  filter(income_level == "low_income") %>% 
  filter(crime_level == "high_crime")

low_income_low_crime <- main %>% 
  filter(income_level == "low_income") %>% 
  filter(crime_level == "low_crime")

high_income_high_crime <- main %>% 
  filter(income_level == "high_income") %>% 
  filter(crime_level == "high_crime")

high_income_low_crime <- main %>% 
  filter(income_level == "high_income") %>% 
  filter(crime_level == "low_crime")

```

##Is there a correlation between crime and income in Baltimore neighborhoods?

There is a moderate correlation between income and crime in Baltimore, with a correlation of 0.5.

```{r}
cor(main$mhhi20, main$crime20)

```



```{r}
gg <- ggplot(main, aes(x=mhhi20, y=crime20)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col=mhhi20)) + 
  geom_smooth(method="loess", se=F) + 
  xlim(c(0, 135000)) + 
  ylim(c(0, 135)) + 
  labs(subtitle="Baltimore, Maryland 2020", 
       y="Crime Rate", 
       x="Median Household Income", 
       title="Correlation Between Income and Crime Rate", 
       caption = "Graphic by Natalie Adams")

plot(gg)


```
